This is an iOS port of the WebGL Flurry, which in turn is a port of Flurry from the original code by [Calum Robinson](https://github.com/calumr) ( [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612005656/http://web.mac.com/calumr/iWeb/Calum%20Robinson/Flurry.html) ).

The project was built with Xcode 6, and is also tested with Xcode 7 Beta 2. It targets iOS 8.
